# PanvasJS

## Welcome to PanvasJS!

PanvasJS is a JavaScript framework for creative coding utilizing the HTML canvas element.

It is a barebones game engine made for people who like the challenge of making 2D video games practically from scratch with just the basic tools for graphics display and mathematical calculations.

It poses a challenge of coding all the logic yourself, including the physics simulations, drawing more complicated shapes, complex math, and much more. It can also be used for simpler things than video games, such as animations and simulations.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with the PanvasJS framework, you can check out the [Get Started page](https://panvasjs.leptr.com) over on the [PanvasJS website](https://panvasjs.leptr.com) and start your first ever PanvasJS project.
